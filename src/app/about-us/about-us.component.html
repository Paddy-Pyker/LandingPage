            <h4>Kaneadua is the first African Video-games digital marketplace, live-broadcasting and viewing platform where viewers can ‘donate’ to their favorite players. <br>It’s a platform that enables anyone to sell the content they've created. As a seller
                you’re in charge of how it’s done: you set the price, you run sales, and you design your pages. Kaneadua is not your typical online web-based and mobile digital storefront, we offer video streaming, and social networking services. <br>It
                also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups. <br>With a wide range of both paid and free content, we encourage you to explore. The Kaneadua platform
                is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming in Africa. Developers on our platform have dashboard access to detailed analytics and about how people discover, download, or play what they've created. Our developer dashboard
                gives easy access to data about what uploads resonate the most or what links drive the most attention.

                <h2>Software delivery and maintenance</h2>
                <br> Kaneadua's primary service is to allow its users to download games and other software that they have in their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, games digital storefront was
                required to be the publisher for these games since they had sole access to the database and engine, but with the introduction of the software development kit (SDK), anyone could potentially become a publisher to Kaneadua.<br> Kaneadua
                support the ability to share most games with family members and close friends by authorizing machines to access one's library. Authorized players can install the game locally and play it separately from the owning account. Users can access
                their saved games and achievements providing the main owner is not playing. When the main player initiates a game while a shared account is using it, the shared account user is allowed a few minutes to either save their progress and close
                the game or purchase the game for his/her own account. Within Family View, parents can adjust settings for their children's tied accounts, limiting the functionality and accessibility to the Kaneadua client and purchased games.
